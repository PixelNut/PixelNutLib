// What Effect Does:
//
//    Modulates the original brightness value that has been set in the drawing
//    properties with a cosine function, such that any affected animation track
//    will have its brightness increase and decrease, continuously.
//
//    The brightness property is modulated up/down from the original value by 20%
//    of full brightness, with the force determining how many steps are taken in a
//    cycle: at full force there are 100 steps to this cycle, increasing to the
//    point where at a force=0 there is no modulation at all.
//
//    So the greater the force the more quickly the associated animation has its
//    brightness change.
//
//    For example: if the original value is set with 'B70', and the trigger force
//    is 400 (max is 1000), then the brightness changes from 70 down to 50, then
//    up to 90, and down to 50 again, and so on, with 250 (1000/400 * 100) steps
//    to the full cycle.
//
// Calling trigger():
//
//    Sets the force used in each step, which is saved and passed on when the
//    brightness reaches a maximum.
//
// Calling nextstep():
//
//    Sets the value of the 'pcentBright' property each time, using the saved force
//    value to determine the modulation with a cosine function. The very first time
//    this is called the median brightness is set to the current property value.
//
// Properties Used:
//
//    pcentBright - read to set the median brightness the very first call to nextstep().
//
// Properties Affected:
//
//    pcentBright - percentage of full brightness (0-100): set each call to nextstep().
//
