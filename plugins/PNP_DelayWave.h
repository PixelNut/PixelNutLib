// What Effect Does:
//
//    Modulates the original delay value that has been set in the drawing properties
//    with a cosine function, such that any affected animation track appears to speed
//    up and then slow down, continuously.
//
//    The delay property is modulated from the original value down to 0 and back, with
//    the force determining how many steps are taken in one cycle: at full force there
//    are 100 steps to this cycle, and as the force is decreased the number of steps
//    increases, to the point where at force=0 there is no modulation at all.
//
//    So the greater the force the more often the associated animation speeds up.
//    And if the original value is 0 (the 'D' command is not used or is set to 0),
//    then this plugin has no effect at all.
//
//    For example: if the original value is set with 'D30', and the trigger force is
//    250 (max is 1000), then the delay value will change from 30, down to 0, and then
//    back to 30, with 400 (1000/250 * 100) steps to the full cycle.
//
// Calling trigger():
//
//    Sets the force used in each step.
//
// Calling nextstep():
//
//    Sets the value of the 'msecsDelay' property each time, using the saved force
//    value to determine the modulation with a cosine function. The very first time
//    this is called the maximum delay is set to the current property value.
//
// Properties Used:
//
//    msecsDelay - read to set the maximum delay the very first call to nextstep().
//
// Properties Affected:
//
//    msecsDelay - delay time in milliseconds: set each call to nextstep().
//
