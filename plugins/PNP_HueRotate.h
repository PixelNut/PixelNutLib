// What Effect Does:
//
//    Rotates color hue around the color wheel on each drawing step, but doesn't change the
//    whiteness or brightness. The amount of change that is made each time is determined by
//    the trigger force.
//
//    The more force the more degrees the hue changes each step. If force is 0 then the color
//    won't change at all. At maximum force the number of steps it takes to cycle through the
//    entire color wheel is exactly the same as the number of pixels.
//
//    Note that until this effect is triggered, the drawing color will stay red and won't change.
//
// Calling trigger():
//
//    Sets the degrees the color hue will change with each call to nextstep().
//
// Calling nextstep():
//
//    Sets the current drawing color and then advances the hue by some amount that was
//    determined by the force in the previous call to trigger().
//
// Properties Used:
//
//    percentWhite, percentBright - current values used to create the drawing color.
//
// Properties Affected:
//
//   degreeHue - advanced by some number of degrees on each call to nextstep()
