// What Effect Does:
//
//    Modulates the original brightness value that has been set in the drawing property,
//    such that any affected animation appears to surge in brightness, then evenly dim
//    down until it is back to its original brightness.
//
//    This effect only happens after a trigger event, with the force determining the
//    amount the value is decreased with each surge. The number of steps it takes
//    is fixed to be 10 steps per the difference in brightness values.
//
//    For example: if the original value is set with 'B50', and the trigger force is
//    500 (max is 1000), then the surge sets the brightness value to 50 + 25
//    (500/1000*(100-50)), and it takes 250 (10*25) calls to 'nextstep()' to bring
//    the value back to 50 again.
//
//    Note: if the original value is 100 (the 'B' command is not used or set to 100),
//    then no modulation is possible and this plugin will have no effect at all.
//
// Calling trigger():
//
//    The first time this is called the min brightness is set to the current value.
//    In all cases the currrent brightness is set based on the amount of force applied:
//    at full force this is 100 (full brightness).
//
// Calling nextstep():
//
//    Decrements the brightness until it becomes the original value in the B command.
//
// Properties Used:
//
//    pcentBright - read to set the median brightness the very first call to nextstep().
//
// Properties Affected:
//
//    pcentBright - percentage of full brightness (0-100): set each call to nextstep().
//
